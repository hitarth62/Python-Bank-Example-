Here's a detailed description of the provided Python code for an ATM system. This code uses the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality and provides a simple command-line interface for managing user accounts, transactions, and other banking operations.

Overview
The ATM system allows users to create an account, log in, perform transactions, check balances, and manage their account details. It uses a text-to-speech engine to provide auditory feedback and instructions to users.

Code Breakdown
1. Imports and Initialization
python
Copy code
import pyttsx3
import os
engine = pyttsx3.init()
pyttsx3: A library used for text-to-speech conversion.
os: Provides functions to interact with the operating system (e.g., file operations).
The engine object initializes the text-to-speech engine.

2. Text-to-Speech Function
python
Copy code
def speek(ex):
    engine.say(ex)
    engine.runAndWait()
speek(ex): A function that takes a string ex, converts it to speech, and waits until the speech has been completed.
3. Welcome Message and Account Creation
python
Copy code
print("Welcome to ATM")
speek("\nDo you have account with us")

while True:
    account = input("Do you have account with us (y/n) :")
    if account.lower() == "n":
        print("Ok , Let's create one")
        while True:
            speek("Enter Username")
            CUsername = input("Enter Username :")
            speek("Enter Password")
            Cpassword = input("Enter Password :")
            
            if CUsername == "" or Cpassword == "":
                print("invalid username or password")
            else:
                with open(f"D:/BANK DATA/DATA/ACCOUNT/ACCOUNT_NO_{CUsername}.txt", "w") as f:
                    f.write(f"0\n{Cpassword}")
                print(f"Congratulation {CUsername} Your Account has been created")    
                break  
        break  

    elif account.lower() == "y":
        break
    else:
        speek("Invalid output")
        print("Invalid output")
    break
Greeting: Prints and speaks a welcome message.
Account Check: Asks if the user has an account. If not, it prompts for account creation.
Account Creation:
Prompts for a username and password.
Validates that neither is empty.
Saves the account details in a file named with the username.
Initializes the balance as 0 and stores the password.
4. User Authentication
python
Copy code
while True:
    speek("Enter Your Username")
    username = input("Enter Your Username :")
    speek("Enter Your Password")
    password = input("Enter Your Password :")
    if username == "" or password == "":
        speek("Invalid username or password")
        print("Invalid username or password")
    else:
        with open(f"D:/BANK DATA/DATA/ACCOUNT/ACCOUNT_NO_{username}.txt", "r") as f:
            data = f.read().split("\n")
        if password == data[1]:
            speek(f"Welcome {username}")
            print(f"Welcome {username}")
            break
        else:
            speek("Invalid username or password")
            print("Invalid username or password")
User Login:
Prompts for username and password.
Reads the corresponding account file to check credentials.
Confirms successful login or displays an error if credentials are incorrect.
